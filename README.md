## HTML5 Canvas:

An HTML5 canvas is added to the form for image preview and filter application.
JavaScript is used to handle image loading and applying filters.

## JavaScript Logic:

loadImage function reads the uploaded image file and sets it as the source for an image preview.
applyFilter function applies the selected filter (none, grayscale, sepia) to the image displayed on the canvas.

## Form and Upload Handling:

The form includes a file input, username input, and content textarea.
When a file is selected, it is displayed as a preview, and users can apply filters before submitting the form.

## Styling:

Basic styling is provided using Tailwind CSS classes for a clean and responsive design.
With this setup, users can preview their uploaded image, apply filters, and share their post, similar to the functionality found in Instagram.
