### Additional Challenge
Develop an image viewer and photo filter editor using HTML5 canvas. This setup should allow users to preview the uploaded image, and then apply basic filters like grayscale or sepia.

This challenge is designed to push your skills further and give you hands-on experience with a more complex application feature.
